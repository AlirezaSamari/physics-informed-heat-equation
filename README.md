# Heat Equation Solver with Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)

An implementation of a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to solve the heat equation.

## Overview

This project aims to solve the heat equation using a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). The heat equation is a partial differential equation that describes the distribution of heat over time in a given region. PINNs combine neural networks with physics-based constraints, making them suitable for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) like the heat equation.
